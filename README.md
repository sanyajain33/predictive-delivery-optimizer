## 🌟 Overview

**Predictive Delivery Optimizer** is a machine learning–powered dashboard that predicts delivery delays *before they occur* and provides actionable insights to improve logistics performance.

The system integrates data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling to help logistics managers enhance delivery reliability, reduce costs, and optimize operations.

## 🧠 Project Objective

To **build an intelligent predictive system** that:
- Detects delivery delays early  
- Predicts delivery status (*On-Time, Slightly-Delayed, Severely-Delayed*)  
- Provides visual analytics for key logistics metrics  
- Enables proactive decision-making and performance improvement
